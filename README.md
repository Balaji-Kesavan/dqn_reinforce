Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in Reinforcement learning is quite interesting to work 

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Before starting, make sure you have installed PyTorch and additional libraries like gym (for environment simulations), and numpy.
Step 2: Understand the Problem
Reinforcement Learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning from it by receiving rewards. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards through trial and error.
The key components are:
* Agent: The learner that takes actions.
* Environment: Where the agent operates (like OpenAI's Gym environments).
* Reward: A feedback signal that helps the agent evaluate its actions.
* Policy: The strategy used by the agent to take actions.
Step 3: Define the Environment
The environment can be any simulation where the agent operates. For example, we will use a basic environment from OpenAI Gym:
Step 4: Build the Q-Network (DQN)
The Q-network is a neural network that approximates the Q-value function, which maps state-action pairs to rewards.
Step 5: Implement the Replay Buffer
A replay buffer stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state, done) to break the correlation between consecutive samples.
Step 6: Train the Agent
Now, we need to define the training process, which involves updating the Q-values based on the agentâ€™s experience
Step 7: Main Loop
The main loop where the agent interacts with the environment and learns from it
Step 8: Hyperparameters and Improvements
* Discount factor (How much future rewards are considered (e.g., 0.99).
* Epsilon decay: Controls how fast exploration (random actions) diminishes.
* Replay buffer size: Controls how much past experience is stored.
* Batch size: Number of samples used to update the model.
Further Improvements
* Double DQN: Helps reduce overestimation bias.
* Prioritized Experience Replay: Improves sample efficiency.
* Dueling DQN: Separates the value function and the advantage function for better policy learning.
